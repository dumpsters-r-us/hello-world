# hello-world
My first repository. 

Me me not good at coding. Dropped out of compsci my first semester at college. Time to change all that. Learned some SQL earlier this year, tried out a bit of Python, and working on some HTML now (then CSS/ Javascript). Maybe I'll post some projects. It's a mystery!

Anyway, just figuring out how to work GitHub.
